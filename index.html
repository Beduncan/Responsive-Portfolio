			<p id="para">HI! My name is Bryant Duncan and I am 19 years old. I come from a big family, I have two bothers (JJ and Coby) and one sister (Cora), my older brother is 24, my little brother is 16, and my sister is 5. I have a girlfriend named corrine and the newest member to the family will be my son Dawson who will be born march.  
			At the moment we have 4 chickens, 3 dogs(Neo, Larry, and Doug), 2 cats (Molly and asami), 10 birds, and two desert tortoise (Donatello and Michelangelo).
			In my free time I enjoy working on cars, riding dirt bikes and snowboardiong the winter, wake board in the summer. I graduated from desert ridge high school class of 2016. From there I went to Mesa Community college for a year with idea of what I was going to do yet. Started my second year but stop to join University of Arizona coding boot camp and I'm hoping to get A job in the field. I have only been coding for a couple of munths but I already realy enjoy it.
